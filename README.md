# RetailDB: Online Retail Application Databases

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building and managing databases for **online retail applications**, which are integral to the e-commerce sector. It includes SQL queries and scripts for analyzing and optimizing an online store's operations, such as customer management, product catalogs, and order processing.

## Key Files
- **OrderDB.sql**: The core SQL script for creating and managing the online storeâ€™s order-related data.
- **_$_FILE_1.docx**: Supporting documentation and data.
- **exp2-solution-template.sql**: Solution template for database queries and analysis.
- **question_4.py**: Python script to process data related to specific retail queries.
- **question_5.py**: Another Python script for analyzing different aspects of retail data.

## Project Description
The **Online Retail Application Databases** project focuses on the design and implementation of SQL-based databases to model the operations of an e-commerce platform. It aims to enhance **data management**, **customer interaction**, and **order tracking** through the use of optimized SQL queries, database normalization, and efficient relationship mapping. The project relies on various SQL operations, such as joins, subqueries, and aggregate functions, to facilitate data analysis and decision-making processes in online retail.

## Objective
The goal is to create a fully functional **database schema** that supports various aspects of an online retail business, focusing on **customer management**, **inventory tracking**, and **order processing**. This includes:
- Managing products, prices, and stock levels.
- Handling customer information, orders, and payments.
- Generating reports and insights on sales, stock levels, and customer behavior.

## Learning Outcomes
1. Design and implement SQL databases for e-commerce applications.
2. Use SQL to query, update, and manage retail data.
3. Analyze and optimize retail data for decision-making.
4. Write Python scripts to process and analyze retail database queries.

## Technologies Used
- **SQL** (Structured Query Language)
- **Python** (for data processing and analysis)
- **Database Management Systems (DBMS)**

## Installation
1. Download the repository files.
2. Set up a database system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
3. Execute the **OrderDB.sql** script to create the database schema.
4. Use Python scripts to process and analyze the data.
5. Refer to the **README.md** for detailed instructions on setting up and using the scripts.
